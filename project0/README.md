# Project 0

Hi there,

I did something simple to simply appreciate what was done in the lectures. I have 4 html files. purpose of each is explained below

1. index.html: I used 2 column grids, to the left is my picture and to the right is a little write while beneath that is the link to the other 3 pages
2. jobs.html: I used the bootstrap template of 3 grids to show my work experience, core competence and qualifications. I used the bootstrap for the links to other 3 pages.
3.careers.html: This was to understand how I can combined bootstrap and css grid while also having image. the page is just a template of my expectation in this course
4. course.html: This is to detail my career goals. Just a template.

My desire is to understand how different templates work while achieving the project objective.
