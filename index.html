                <p class="about">Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE), Certified Card Payment System Professionals (CCPSP) and a dynamic Back-office operation analyst in the e-payment financial industry. With a track record of monitoring real time queues and identifying high-risk transactions among flagged triggers. I pride myself with the ability to investigate, analyse and interpret trends or patterns in complex financial customer data sets. I used statistical techniques to generate quarterly, annual and random fraud reports that highlights high-risk channels as well as mitigation measures for the industry. I have excellent skill set in generating fraud rules on robust anti-fraud solution (i.e. HEIMDALL)</p>
